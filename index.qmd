![](images/ProfilePic.jpg){style="float:left; padding-right: 50px" fig-alt="" width="300"} Hi, I'm Hui Ying!

I am currently in my first post-doc journey at the Singapore Management University (SMU), working on a research project - "Developing a risk assessment and communication platform to translate climate projections to policy". It entails developing a climate risk assessment for Singapore - focusing on risks to the built environment from pluvial flooding, sea-level rise, and urban overheating, which aims to inform policies.

Prior to my postdoctoral research, my Masters and PhD research at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) lie in the nexus of environmental monitoring, remote sensing and machine learning applications. I had the opportunity to work on various interdisciplinary projects in riverine, inland water bodies, and coastal environments in Malaysia and Singapore through close collaborations with academic, agencies, and industry professionals.

Translating theory to practical applications is the principal goal in my professional work, which has spurred me to create many [open-source projects](https://github.com/pakhuiying) with the community in mind, and applying my [research output](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sphg4YUAAAAJ&hl=en) in industrial domains.
